## First Memo

It looks very easy

Kinda looks like a convolution networking thingi

so, we have to do the 3x3 matrix for the whole grid

## Finished in 0:42:25

Took some time fiddling around with the c++ settings

I thought it would need more optimization but my attempt worked

Memoizing repeated area between iteration could be one of the opimization, maybe?

I set the `MEDIAN_POSITION` 5 at first, which was wrong, later changed to 4.
