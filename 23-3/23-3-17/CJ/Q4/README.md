So, I got the most of the data structure and algorithm done pretty early.

However, how I set up the sub_tree was very wrong.

When I first wrote sub_tree, I set the head of sub_tree to be empty.

However, I thought the head contained actual data.

That caused problem with printing + attaching to the end.

attach_to_lowest_common_ancester was little bit confusing to write,
because the base itself was a empty pointer and it was a recursive function.

Implementing a tree structure is pretty hard.
