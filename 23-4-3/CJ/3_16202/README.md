I used Kruskal's Algo for making MST.

One thing that I got wrong at the first time is "merging of different trees".

When merging, finding the highest parent nodes and assigning it to the node of lower number is the right thing.

Funny fact is that, the one condition where "delete the edge with lowest weight" is literally poping the priority_queue.
