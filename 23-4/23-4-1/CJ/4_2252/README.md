It was a topological sort problem.

I have solved it in the past.

Last time, I got it on the first try.

However, this time I tried 5 times.

Firstly, I didn't think about the pre-required numbers being more than two.

So I had to change it to vectors

Secondly, I had to thoroughly check the visited state, because I got an TLE.
