Wow! This problem is so unkind.

I misunderstood the what x, y, z meant at the first time.

I thought x, y, z were unique natural numbers, but they were not.

Then, what I didn't catch until the end was that x, y, z can go above 1001.

Got damn it.

I thought of many clever ways to compute the answer, however, I should have
checked the size of input and just went for the easiest way.

The answer was the easiest approach, O(n^3).

I have so much to go.
